text,31.05408391778296,-111.79687500000001,,Muhheconneok,,The People of the Waters That Are Never Still,"As more and more Europeans settled here, the Mohicans lost their ownership of the land and found themselves increasingly dependent on the settlers for goods that they had traditionally sourced from nature. Eventually the Mohicans were pushed east to the Housatonic River in what is now Massachusetts. The tribe was also catastrophically affected by diseases that the Europeans brought, which decreased their numbers greatly. In the mid-1780s, the Stockbridge Mohican people moved to New Stockbridge near Oneida Lake, where they had been offered a tract of land. However land companies focused on profit proposed that New York State remove all Indians from within its borders, and the tribe was forced to move again, this time to the White River area in what is now Indiana. Meanwhile, missionaries, agents from the state of New York, and commissioners from the War Department were negotiating with the Menominee and Ho- Chunk (Winnebago) for a large tract of land on which to relocate the Indigenous people from New York in what is now Wisconsin. A treaty was negotiated in 1822 and the Stockbridge Mohicans moved yet again, this time to the reservation in Wisconsin, where they still reside today.[^1] [^1]:https://flyingdeernaturecenter.org/the-muhheconneok/",24,0,0,0,,,Tribes

The people complained to the god Hobomok that the beaver was greedy, and consuming all their resources. In response Hobomok decided to kill the beaver with a club he fashioned from a large tree. After the struggle, the beaver died, sank to the bottom of the lake, turned to stone, and became what is now Wequamps Mountain. Geological evidence shows that 15,000 years ago the area was infact a massive post-glacial lake and that a now extinct species of giant beaver as big as black bears once inhabited the area about the same time ",10,0,0,0,,,Mountains
