                Ice trolls of the Shardwild roam between migrating glacier barges
                and subglacial cavern-halls warmed by geothermal vents. Though
                towering and formidable, they are deliberate in conflict and
                fiercely protective of the ley-fed icefields that sustain their
                ancestral memory pools.
              </p>
              <p>
                Troll kinship is defined by the sharing of breathstone shards—
                crystalline memory nodes carried in throat pouches. Exchanging a
                shard binds two trolls to mutual defense and to the retelling of
                each other's life-songs during thaw festivals.

                Ice trolls maintain a secondary heart that pumps antifreeze serum
                through dermal canals, preventing frostbite even during whiteout
                tempests. Their tusks grow hollow chambers used to resonate
                clan signals across snowfields.

                    During deep winter, trolls enter a weeks-long trance beneath
                    heated cairns. They emerge with wounds sealed by new icebone
                    growth directed by carved sigils lining the cairn walls.

                    Specialized sinus cavities allow them to map tunnels via low
                    thrums. Scouts can detect intruders by reading the distortions
                    in reflected resonance frost patterns.

                Enclaves are carved within blue-ice shelves reinforced by basalt
                ribs hauled from volcanic fissures. Public halls glow with
                captured starlight stored in rune-etched prisms, while private
                alcoves nestle behind curtains of woven frostvine.

                  Polar Survey teams recorded zero collapse incidents within
                  troll-carved vaults across thirty winters. Structural integrity
                  is maintained by harmonic chanting that realigns microfractures

                Breathstone pools serve as communal archives. Elders submerge
                their hands to replay ancestral deeds, mentoring youths in the
                etiquette of oathweaving—binding promises sung across frozen
                canyons to sanctify alliances.

                Storykeepers engrave saga knots into their fur during the

                penance owed to neighboring peoples.

                The Hoarfrost Pact binds ice trolls with frost elves and human
                beacon guilds. Pact envoys maintain thawed waystations along
                trade glaciers, ensuring safe passage for goods in exchange for
                rune-etched copper needed to stabilize breathstone caches.

                Hostilities persist with fire giant forges that encroach upon
                sacred meltwater basins. Troll warbands favor ambushes staged
                beneath aurora veils, shattering enemy arms with resonance pulses
                amplified through tusk arrays.
