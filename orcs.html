                The orcish polities of the Border Marches trace their lineage to
                migratory bands that followed the thunder-crow migrations during
                the late fourth century. Contrary to garrison rumors, these
                societies are neither anarchic nor permanently at war; they
                balance martial readiness with a ritual calendar that regulates
                hunting, ironworking, and clan diplomacy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Confederacy envoys describe a political structure rooted in
                <strong>blood-keeps</strong>—extended households that pledge
                warriors, stewards, and stone-singers to a rotating high warband.
                Each blood-keep maintains a seasonal stronghold and a network of
                relay shrines. Outsiders who offer water at the shrines are
                typically granted safe passage to the outlying markets.

                Orcish clans are federated through oath-circles that convene
                beneath the Black Pines, a sacred grove said to remember every
                war chant ever sung. Delegations arrive bearing drums carved with
                their migration history. Decisions are rendered by consensus; a
                single dissenting drummer can delay war plans by one lunar cycle.

                    field the famed <em>ashlance</em> cavalry and maintain beacons

                Surveyors note that strongholds rise in concentric terraces cut
                directly from basalt. Lower rings host communal forges and
                market squares, while the middle terraces hold training courts
                and seed granaries. The highest terraces are quiet spaces reserved
                for dream interpreters and night sentries.

                Defensive walls appear jagged when viewed from a distance, a
                result of alternating crenelations and horn totems. Each totem
                houses thunderstones tuned to a clan's battle rhythm. When storms
                roll across the ranges, the totems hum—an audible ledger of which
                keep currently holds the high warband standard.

                  Stone-singers coax resonant seams in the cliff face before the
                  carving crews advance. This practice reduces rockfall and is
                  cited by engineer Captain Yara Estwin as the reason orcish
                  terraces withstand artillery better than imperial bastions.

                Ritual smithing remains central to orcish cultural identity. Each
                warrior maintains two blades: a practical field blade and a
                ceremony blade etched with the storms they have outrun. Blades are
                retired only when the owner's lineage produces a new stone-singer.

                Seasonal rites blend martial rehearsal with hospitality. Guests
                from allied peoples are offered fermented pine sap and seating on
                the windward balconies to witness the <strong>Song of Ashes</strong>
                —a polyphonic chant that recounts the founding migrations. Younger
                orcs learn steps by shadowing their elders, ensuring continuity
                without written notation.

                The Border Marches confederate councils maintain a braided record
                known as the <em>cord of witness</em>. Each strand documents an
                alliance, woven annually by heraldic apprentices. Key accords
                include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Stonewake Compact (1742)</strong> — establishes
                  sanctuary protocols with the Karthi River Monasteries.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Second Ember Exchange (1821)</strong> — guarantees
                  trade of smelted copper for aurora dyes crafted by tundra
                  artisans.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Stormgate Concord (1968)</strong> — formalizes mutual
                  defense between the orcish high warband and the Black Pines
                  Confederacy against incursive airship fleets.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Disputes are mediated by itinerant arbiters who memorize the cord
                sequences. Breaking a strand is a grave offense; offenders must
                present three new treaties to replace the severed bond or submit
                to exile.
