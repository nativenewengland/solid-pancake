                The goblins of the Border Guilds inhabit sprawling warrens beneath
                market towns, connecting surface plazas to subterranean foundries
                through a lattice of freight lifts and pneumatic runners. Their
                society prizes redundancy: every guildhall is mirrored by a
                shadow-hall that can resume operations within an hour of seizure
                by outside forces.
              </p>
              <p>
                Goblin governance is contractual rather than hereditary. Compact
                tablets etched in brass encode profit-sharing formulas, labor
                protections, and security protocols. Violating a contract invites
                censure by the Ledger Circle, whose arbiters command both
                financial sanctions and the loyalty of hidden strike teams.

                Three interlocking syndicates dominate the Border Guild economy.
                Their representatives convene quarterly in the Vaulted Forum to
                reconcile ledgers, reroute caravans, and schedule neutral market
                days for outsiders.

                Goblin tinker-cells favor modular construction. Tools slot into
                universal grip braces, and furnace arrays can be reconfigured in
                under six minutes using color-coded latch runes. Apprentices are
                evaluated on their ability to improvise replacements when parts
                arrive corroded or embargoed.

                  Inspector Vyre observed that goblin steamworks vent excess
                  pressure through melody pipes tuned to dissonant intervals. The
                  resulting wail doubles as an evacuation signal recognized by
                  every guild apprentice by their second year.

                Currency flows through ledger stones keyed to palmprints.
                Syndicate treasurers settle disputes by exchanging weighted
                promissory gears whose teeth represent fractional ownership of
                future shipments.

                When trading with surface kingdoms, goblins prefer escrow vaults
                guarded by neutral golem brokers. Caravan masters receive a
                single chromed chit that, when split, voids the agreement—an
                incentive to keep negotiations cordial and punctual.

                The Border Guilds maintain standing accords with the orcish
                Verdant Tide Circle for grain logistics and with halfling
                river barges for long-distance smuggling. Relations with human
                duchies fluctuate depending on tariff enforcement.

                Tensions remain high with the Stoneking dwarves after the
                sabotage of the Bronze Gate lockworks. Diplomatic repair hinges
                on the goblins delivering the schematics of the disputed pressure
                regulator, a concession the Ledger Circle continues to delay.
